<!--
Create a web page about yourself or a subject you are interested in, using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Your submission should consist of 3 files:

A HTML document
A CSS document
A JavaScript document 

You can also upload additional files such as jQuery or Bootstrap if needed. 

The web page should have the following features:

It should display correctly if the person viewing it has placed all the files you have supplied in a folder on their machine
It should use at least one of each of HTML img, h1 and div tags (and more if needed)
It should use CSS to set the style of the text and other parts of the design as appropriate, in at least 3 ways.
It should be responsive - it should change the layout if the screen size changes
The user should be able to change the page in some way by interacting with a GUI element such as a button. 
Write some text on the page explaining how the user can interact. You should implement this feature using JavaScript. -->
